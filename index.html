    <p>
        By using our services, you acknowledge and agree to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We are committed to safeguarding your personal information and ensuring that your privacy is protected. We only collect data that is necessary for the provision of our services and, in doing so, adhere to the principles of data minimization and purpose limitation. We will not sell, distribute, or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your explicit permission or are required by law to do so. Any information collected may be used to personalize your experience, improve our services, and ensure the security of your account.

        All data is stored securely using industry-standard encryption technologies, and we take appropriate measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of your personal information. Access to your data is restricted to authorized personnel who need it to perform their job duties. In the event of a data breach, we will promptly notify affected individuals and take necessary steps to mitigate any potential damage.

        While we take reasonable precautions to protect your data, you acknowledge that no system is entirely secure. You agree to take appropriate measures to protect your own information, including but not limited to safeguarding your account credentials and limiting access to your devices. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your account to prevent unauthorized access.

        Furthermore, we may use third-party service providers to perform certain functions on our behalf, such as hosting, data processing, and analytics. These third-party providers are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information and may only use it to perform the services we request. They are prohibited from using your data for their own purposes or sharing it with others without our consent. By using our services, you agree that we may share your data with these trusted partners as necessary to operate and enhance our services.

        We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice. It is your responsibility to review this policy periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes. Your continued use of our services constitutes your acceptance of any modifications to the terms outlined in this document.
